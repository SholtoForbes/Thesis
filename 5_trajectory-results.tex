\chapter{Trajectory Results}\label{chapter:numerical}




\section{Third Stage trajectory}
-Details on methodology
-outline the limits that I put on it (ie cant go below starting altitude)
-I should maybe run a case without these limits to show the difference
-outline necessity for differing guess (will need to cite this as a regularly used process)

\section{SPARTAN trajectory}
-constant q
-45kPa,50kPa and 55kPa limited trajectories
-high drag trajectory

-it might be interesting to compare different third stage rocket engines 

\section{First Stage Trajectory}
multiple release points
-fixed mass, optimal velocity
-fixed velocity, optimal mass

\section{Flyback trajectories }

-first stage to subsonic flight? 
-second stage
Abort analysis?
