\chapter{Third Stage Sizing Study}

- I need to frame this well, so that it does not seem to invalidate my previous work

-Variation of third stage design, changing width, length, thrust, CL and CD of the third stage, and recalculating optimised trajectories.

-Determine the optimal sizing of the third stage 

-Analyse the variation in the optimal trajectory with variation in third stage design



- could do a small cost analysis of the third stage using transcost, compare to payload-to-orbit

\section{Third Stage Sizing}

-diameter and length of centrebody changed independently

-length varied

-changed mass of cork cylinder
-changed aerodynamics
-changed total mass

-diameter varied
-changed mass of cork cylinder and C-C cone
-changed aerodynamics
-changed total mass
-changed engine efficiency from nozzle size
