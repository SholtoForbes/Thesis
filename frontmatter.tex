Please find enclosed the current draft of the thesis entitled 'Trajectory Optimisation of a Partially-Reusable Rocket-Scramjet-Rocket Small Satellite Launch System'. This thesis aims to determine the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of a small satellite launcher incorporating the SPARTAN scramjet-powered accelerator. Using the optimal trajectory calculated, the effect of design changes to the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system are investigated.

Optimal control theory is used, along with a detailed vehicle simulation, to calculate the optimal trajectory shape. The vehicle has been successfully simulated in six degrees of freedom, with aerodynamic properties calculated using computational fluid dynamics. 
 The proprietary optimal control program, GPOPS-2, has successfully been configured to optimise the trajectory shape of the launch system, as a combined optimisation (ie. taking all necessary stages into account simultaneously). The optimal trajectory shape has been calculated for the ascent of all three stages, along with the fly-back of the SPARTAN to its initial launch site. Key design parameters of the vehicle have been varied, and used to investigate the sensitivity of the optimised payload-to-orbit. The optimised trajectory results are currently being enhanced through the improvement of the vehicle model. Simulations are currently being run to add the thrust obtained from some additional areas of the SPARTAN. These thrust components require additional CFD simulations which take into account the engine exit conditions. On completion of these simulations, optimised trajectories will be able to be generated rapidly for all scenarios. 

This thesis contains eight chapters;
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 Introduction: Mostly complete, bar the addition of new information generated by the CFD simulations currently being computed. This chapter is at second review stage.
\item 2 Literature Review: Nearing completion, requiring only the addition of a CFD solver survey.
\item 3 Launch Vehicle Design and Simulation: Mostly complete, bar the addition of new information generated by the CFD simulations currently being computed. This chapter is at second review stage.
\item 4 LODESTAR: A relatively short chapter in the early draft stages, describing the specific set-up of the optimal control problem. 
\item 5 Optimised Ascent Trajectory: Based on a paper which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets.
The results of this chapter will be updated for the newly calculated aerodynamics, and for improved optimisation processes, and the sensitivity analysis will be expanded slightly. The core analysis in this chapter is expected to change little.
\item 6 Optimised Trajectory Including Fly-Back: An expanded form of the paper 'Fly-Back of a Scramjet-Powered Accelerator', presented at Scitech 2018. This paper contains an analysis of the optimised fly-back trajectory, and this analysis is expected to change little. This chapter will be expanded to contain the concurrently optimised trajectories of the SPARTAN ascent and fly-back, and the third stage rocket, all of which is currently operational and awaiting the updated aerodynamic results. The analysis of the ascent stages will primarily be a comparison with Chapter 5. 
\item 7 Design and Optimisation of the Third Stage Rocket: Requires the final trajectory optimisation to be operational before results are able to be generated, at which point it is a fairly simple matter of varying the third stage design. 
\item 8 Conclusions: Will be completed after results have been finalised. 
\end{itemize}
