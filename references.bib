abstract = {The supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, is the engine cycle most suitable for sustained hypersonic flight in the atmosphere. This article describes some challenges in the design of the inlet or intake of these hypersonic air-breathing engines. Scramjet inlets are a critical component and their design has important effects on the overall performance of the engine. The role of the inlet is first described, followed by a description of inlet types and some past examples. Recommendations on the level of compression needed in scramjets are then made, followed by a design example of a three-dimensional scramjet inlet for use in an access-to-space system that must operate between Mach 6 and 12.},

abstract = {A general strategy is identified to compute the minimum fuel required for the ascent of a generic hypersonic vehicle that is propelled by a dual-mode ramjet–scramjet engine with hydrogen fuel. The study addresses the ascent of an accelerator vehicle rather than a high-speed cruiser. Two general types of ascent trajectories are considered: acceleration within scramjet mode, and acceleration across the ramjet–scramjet transition boundary maximum acceleration and maximum dynamic pressure (lowest allowed altitude) were shown to be near optimum for scramjet- mode trajectories, but optimized trajectories were found to be more complex when both modes are considered. The first-principles model used in this paper computes the combustion efficiency using finite-rate chemistry and a fuel–air mixing model. It also computes the inlet efficiency with a shock wave interaction code, and thus avoids empirical formulas for efficiency that were used in previous models.},

abstract = {Scramjet engines promise signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase of low- Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difﬁculty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 612 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled ﬁnal-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled to deliver approximately 100 kg to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5\% with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efﬁcient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most signiﬁcant improvement to their use for space access.},

abstract = {The reentry trajectory optimization for hypersonic vehicle (HV) is a current problem of great interest. Some complex constraints, such as waypoints for reconnaissance and no-fly zones for threat avoidance, are inevitably involved in a global strike mission. Of the many direct methods, Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) has been demonstrated as an effective tool to solve the trajectory optimization problem with typical constraints. However, a series of difficulties arises for complex constraints, such as the uncertainty of passage time for waypoints and the inaccuracy of approximate trajectory near no-fly zones. The research herein proposes a multi-phase technique based on the GPM to generate an optimal reentry trajectory for HV satisfying waypoint and no-fly zone constraints. Three kinds of specific breaks are introduced to divide the full trajectory into multiple phases. The continuity conditions are presented to ensure a smooth connection between each pair of phases. Numerical examples for reentry trajectory optimization in free-space flight and with complex constraints are used to demonstrate the proposed technique. Simulation results show the feasible application of multi-phase technique in reentry trajectory optimization with waypoint and no-fly zone constraints. ?? 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA.},

Our results show that three-axis magnetic attitude stabilization can be achieved by using a pseudospectral control law via the receding horizon control in elliptic orbits. The solutions from the pseudospectral control law are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the Riccati equation, but the computation speed improves by one order of magnitude. For the case investigated, the results show the effects of the known disturbing pitch torque are minimized when the satellite is in an unstable gravity gradient configuration.},

abstract = {The FORMOSA Satellite Series No. 3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) spacecraft constellation consisting of six low-earth-orbiting satellites is the world's first operational Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation mission. The mission has been jointly developed by the National Space Organization of Taiwan and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research of the U.S. in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and the Naval Research Laboratory for three onboard payloads, including a GPS Occultation Receiver, a triband beacon, and a tiny ionospheric photometer. The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission was successfully launched from Vandenberg into the same orbit plane of the designated 516-km circular parking orbit altitude on April 15, 2006. After the six satellites completed the in-orbit checkout activities, the mission was started immediately at the parking orbit for in-orbit checkout, calibration, and experiment of three onboard payloads. Individual spacecraft thrust burns for orbit raising were performed to begin the constellation deployment of the satellites into six separate orbit planes. All six FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites are maintained in a good state of health except spacecraft flight model no. 2, which has had power shortages. Five out of the six satellites had reached their final mission orbits of 800 km as of November 2007. This paper provides an overview of the constellation spacecraft design, constellation mission operations, constellation deployment timeline evolution, associated spacecraft mass property and moment of inertia results, orbit-raising challenges, and lessons learned during the orbit-raising operations.},

abstract = {In view of generating optimal trajectories of Bolza problems, standard Chebyshev pseudospectral (PS) method makes the points' accumulation near the extremities and rarefaction of nodes close to the center of interval, which causes an ill-condition of differentiation matrix and an oscillation of the optimal solution. For improvement upon the difficulties, a mapped Chebyshev pseudospectral method is proposed. A conformal map is applied to Chebyshev points to move the points closer to equidistant nodes. Condition number and spectral radius of differentiation matrices from both methods are presented to show the improvement. Furthermore, the modification keeps the Chebyshev pseudospectral method's advantage, the spectral convergence rate. Based on three numerical examples, a comparison of the execution time, convergence and accuracy is presented among the standard Chebyshev pseudospectral method, other collocation methods and the proposed one. In one example, the error of results from mapped Chebyshev pseudospectral method is reduced to 5\% of that from standard Chebyshev pseudospectral method. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA.},

abstract = {Horizontal takeoff and landing two-stage systems with an airbreathing first stage and rocket second stage are evaluated for staging Mach numbers that range from 5 to 14. All systems are evaluated with advanced technologies being developed in the NASP Program and sized to the same mission requirements. With these advanced technologies, the two-stage systems are heavier than the single stage. The weights of the two-stage systems are closely related to staging. Using a rocket on the first stage to accelerate from the turboramjet limit of Mach 6 to Mach 10 signiificantly decreases dry weight as compared to the Mach 6-staged system. The optimum dry weight staging Mach number for the scramjet two-stage system is Mach 12. At a 40 percent weight growth (current technology level), the scramjet two-stage systems are half the weight and less sensitive to weight changes than the single stage, but still require substantial technology development in the areas of inlets, nozzles, ramjet propulsion, active cooling, and high-temperature structures.},

abstract = {An overview is presented of three different pseudospectral methods based on collocation at Legendre-Gauss (LG), Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR), and Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points. For each of the schemes presented here, (1) the state at the final time can be expressed in terms of a quadrature rule associated with the collocatio n points, (2) the state at the initial time is approximated by interpolation, and (3) the control and the state are approximated at the collocation points. The LG-based and LGR-based schemes presented here employ polynomials to approximate the state that are the same degree as the number of collocation points. In the corresponding LGL scheme, the state approximation is a polynomial that is one degree lower than the number of collocation points. Each of these scheme can be expressed in either a differential or an integral formulation. The LG a nd LGR differentiation and inte- gration matrices are invertible, and the differential and i ntegral versions are equivalent. The LGL differentiation matrix is singular and the equivalence between the differential and in- tegral version is lost. For each scheme, the transformation between the KKT multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem and costates of the continuous optimal control problem is developed. The LGL collocation is the only scheme for which the differentiation matrices for the state and the costate dynamics are the same. Two examples are used to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme.},

abstract = {This paper describes an improvement in designing a real time optimal multiple-burn trajectory that should be rapid and adaptive. The computational cost for solving a multiple-burn trajectory problem comes from 1) trajectory propagation (or simulation of a trajectory) and 2) trajectory iterations (or computation of gradient information). Tremendous work has been done to reduce this cost, especially in the area of increasing the solution convergence or gradient calculation speed. However, in applications such as an orbit-to-orbit transfer, a long range payload delivery, or a medium or low thrust-to-weight ratio trajectory, the propagation time of the coast arc is the dominant one of the computational cost, and thus several studies have been focused on solving this problem by using parallel computing techniques. In this paper, through an oscillation frequency study of the switching function, the propagation of the coast arc is avoided and “ safely ” replaced by a zero-ﬁnding program. Using this method, the speed of the real time trajectory design is increased. Numerical implementation issues of this algorithm are discussed in detail. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, four trajectory designs have been simulated: two Hohmann-type orbital transfers, a low Earth orbital insertion, and the McCue problem. Atmospheric drag and J2 perturbations have been considered in these simulations.},

abstract = {The rise in launch and use of small satellites in the past decade, a result of improved functionality through technology miniaturisation and alternative design philosophies, has spawned interest in the development of distributed systems or constellations of small satellites. However, whilst a variety of missions based on constellations of small satellites have been proposed, issues relating to the launch and deployment of these distributed systems mean that few have actually been realised. A number of strategies have been proposed which enable multiple small satellites comprising a constellation to be launched together and efficiently separated on-orbit, thus reducing the total cost of launch. In this paper, two such strategies which have the potential to significantly increase the viability of small satellite constellations in Earth orbit are investigated. Deployment using natural Earth perturbations to indirectly achieve plane separations is analysed using a developed method and compared to deployment utilising the Earth-Moon Lagrange point L<inf>1</inf> as a staging area prior to return to LEO. The analysis of three example missions indicates that these two strategies can facilitate the successful establishment of small satellite constellations in Earth orbit whilst also reducing propulsive requirements, system complexity, and/or cost. The study also found that the method of nodal precession is sensitive to the effects of orbital decay due to drag and can result in long deployment times, and the use of Lunar L<inf>1</inf> is more suitable for constellation configurations where several satellites are present in each orbital plane.},

@article{Casiano2010,
abstract = {Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs) are capable of on-command variable thrust or thrust modulation, an operability advantage that has been studied intermittently since the late 1930s. Throttleable LREs can be used for planetary entry and descent, space rendezvous, orbital maneuvering including orientation and stabilization in space, and hovering and hazard avoidance during planetary landing. Other applications have included control of aircraft rocket engines, limiting of vehicle acceleration or velocity using retrograde rockets, and ballistic missile defense trajectory control. Throttleable LREs can also continuously follow the most economical thrust curve in a given situation, compared to discrete throttling changes over a few select operating points. The effects of variable thrust on the mechanics and dynamics of an LRE as well as difficulties and issues surrounding the throttling process are important aspects of throttling behavior. This review provides a detailed survey of LRE throttling centered around engines from the United States. Several LRE throttling methods are discussed, including high-pressure-drop systems, dual-injector manifolds, gas injection, multiple chambers, pulse modulation, throat throttling, movable injector components, and hydrodynamically dissipative injectors. Concerns and issues surrounding each method are examined, and the advantages and shortcomings compared.},

abstract = {An algorithm is described to solve multiple-phase optimal control problems using a recently developed numerical method called the Gauss pseudospectral method. The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS, is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages. © 2010 ACM.},

@article{Trivailo2012,
abstract = {The primary purpose of this paper is to review currently existing cost estimation methods, models, tools and resources applicable to the space sector. While key space sector methods are outlined, a specific focus is placed on hardware cost estimation on a system level, particularly for early mission phases during which specifications and requirements are not yet crystallised, and information is limited. For the space industry, cost engineering within the systems engineering framework is an integral discipline. The cost of any space program now constitutes a stringent design criterion, which must be considered and carefully controlled during the entire program life cycle. A first step to any program budget is a representative cost estimate which usually hinges on a particular estimation approach, or methodology. Therefore appropriate selection of specific cost models, methods and tools is paramount, a difficult task given the highly variable nature, scope as well as scientific and technical requirements applicable to each program. Numerous methods, models and tools exist. However new ways are needed to address very early, pre-Phase 0 cost estimation during the initial program research and establishment phase when system specifications are limited, but the available research budget needs to be established and defined. Due to their specificity, for vehicles such as reusable launchers with a manned capability, a lack of historical data implies that using either the classic heuristic approach such as parametric cost estimation based on underlying CERs, or the analogy approach, is therefore, by definition, limited. This review identifies prominent cost estimation models applied to the space sector, and their underlying cost driving parameters and factors. Strengths, weaknesses, and suitability to specific mission types and classes are also highlighted. Current approaches which strategically amalgamate various cost estimation strategies both for formulation and validation of an estimate, and techniques and/or methods to attain representative and justifiable cost estimates are consequently discussed. Ultimately, the aim of the paper is to establish a baseline for development of a non-commercial, low cost, transparent cost estimation methodology to be applied during very early program research phases at a complete vehicle system level, for largely unprecedented manned launch vehicles in the future. This paper takes the first step to achieving this through the identification, analysis and understanding of established, existing techniques, models, tools and resources relevant within the space sector. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A control-oriented model of the powertrain and vehicle dynamics is built first. The energy management is formulated as a typical optimal control problem to trade off the fuel consumption and gear shifting frequency under admissible constraints. The Dynamic Programming (DP) and Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) are applied to obtain the optimal solutions. Tuning with the appropriate co-states, the PMP solution is found to be very close to that from DP. The solution for the gear shifting in PMP has an algebraic expression associated with the vehicular velocity and can be implemented more efficiently in the control algorithm. The computation time of PMP is significantly less than DP.},

abstract = {Scramjet engines promise signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase of low- Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difﬁculty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 612 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled ﬁnal-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled to deliver approximately 100 kg to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5\% with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efﬁcient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most signiﬁcant improvement to their use for space access.},

abstract = {NPSAT1 is a small satellite being built at the Naval Postgraduate School, and due to launch in January 2006. It uses magnetic actuators and a pitch momentum wheel for attitude control. In this paper, a novel time-optimal sampled-data feedback control algorithm is introduced for closed-loop control of NPSAT1 in the presence of disturbances. The feedback law is not analytically explicit; rather, it is obtained by a rapid re-computation of the open-loop time-optimal control at each update instant. The implementation of the proposed controller is based on a shrinking horizon approach and does not require any advance knowledge of the computation time. Preground-test simulations show that the proposed control scheme performs well in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbance torques},

abstract = {This paper presents the problem of on-line trajectory optimization for a typical Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle (ABLV). The particular objective of fuel optimal ascent is examined for constant dynamic pressure ascent segment of an air-breathing Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) mission. Functional dependence of air-breathing engine thrust on vehicle flight path (h-V) and angle of attack has major impact on the nature of fuel optimal ascent trajectories. The amount of uncertainties in aerodynamic parameters is significantly greater for ABLVs compared to expendable rocket launch vehicles. Due to above reasons guidance and control technology dependent on pre- launch, predetermined trajectory as used in conventional launch vehicles is inadequate for ABLVs. This paper presents the on-line generation of optimal trajectories using energy state approximation approach for flight of a point mass in a vertical plane over a spherical non-rotating Earth. The algorithm proves to be computationally efficient and suitable for real time implementation. Performance of the algorithm is evaluated through extensive flight simulations for a generic ABLV with launch mass of 200t and 10t payload.},

abstract = {We consider analysis and design of low sonic-boom aircraft through the use of an invis- cid, embedded-boundary Cartesian mesh method. Adjoint error estimation and adaptive meshing are used in the analysis portion of this study to determine resolution requirements of the computational domain, while adjoint-based gradients in conjunction with a parallel optimization framework are used for design. Two analysis examples are presented. The first is a verification study that shows excellent accuracy of mesh converged pressure sig- nals when sampled both on-track and off-track at distances of 1.8 body lengths on meshes with \~{}13 million cells. The second is a validation study of a low-boom model that shows close agreement between wind tunnel experiments and off-body pressure signals computed via our Cartesian approach. The optimization example uses an inverse design approach to re-shape a low-boom Mach 1.6 aircraft traveling at 45,000 ft. A detailed parametric model is constructed in the RAGE modeler with approximately 180 parameters used as design variables. Optimization reduced the perceived ground noise level by \~{}10 dB to a rating of 76.7 PLdB while maintaining the lift and drag performance of the aircraft. Our discussion shows that for functionals with certain common forms, the adjoint solution provides a de- tailed bookkeeping that can highlight specific regions of the aircraft that contribute to the cost function. In such cases, examination of the adjoint solution directly highlights critical portions of the model, encouraging designers to efficiently select design variables.},

It represents a very intuitive (and easy to program) methodology for global optimization, inspired by the behavior of bird ﬂocks while searching for food. The particle swarm optimization technique attempts to take advantage of the mechanism of information sharing that affects the overall behavior of a swarm, with the intent of determining the optimal values of the unknown parameters of the problem under consideration. In this research the method is applied to a variety of space trajectory optimization problems, i.e., the determination of periodic orbits in the context of the circular restricted three-body problem, and the optimization of (impulsive and ﬁnite thrust) orbital transfers. Despite its simplicity and intuitiveness, the particle swarm algorithm proves to be quite effective in ﬁnding the optimal solution to all of the applications considered in the paper, with great numerical accuracy.},

Presenting a survey of a field as diverse as trajectory optimization is a daunting task. The author focuses on the two types of methods most widely used today, namely, direct and indirect. I begin the discussion with a brief review of the underlying mathematics in both direct and indirect methods. I then discuss the complications that occur when path and boundary constraints are imposed on the problem description. Finally, I describe unresolved issues that are the subject of ongoing research},

abstract = {An algorithm is described to solve multiple-phase optimal control problems using a recently developed numerical method called the Gauss pseudospectral method. The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS, is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages. © 2010 ACM.},

This paper identifies this method as a direct transcription method and proceeds to investigate the relationship between the original optimal-control problem and the nonlinear-programming problem. The discretized adjoint equation of the collocation method is found to have deficient accuracy, and an alternate scheme which discretizes the equations of motion using an explicit Runge-Kutta parallel-shooting approach is developed.

Therefore, not only launching small satellites with expendable rockets on non-regular flights but also with reusable rockets on regular flights should be considered for the long term. However, developing, producing and operating reusable rockets require a fundamental change in the current "business as usual" philosophy. Under current conditions, it might not be possible to develop, to produce or to operate a reusable vehicle fleet economically. The favorite philosophy is based on "smart business" processes adapted by the authors using cost engineering techniques. In the following paper, major strategies for reducing costs are discussed, which are applied for a representative program proposal. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gursul2005,
abstract = {Unsteady aerodynamics of nonslender delta wings, covering topics of shear layer instabilities, structure of nonslender vortices, breakdown, maneuvering wings, and fluid/structure interactions, are reviewed in this paper. Vortical flows develop at very low angles of attack, and form close to the wing surface. This results in strong interactions with the upper-surface boundary layer and in a pronounced dependence of the flow structure on Reynolds number. Vortex breakdown is observed to be much less abrupt compared to breakdown over slender wings. This results in challenges for the precise determination of vortex breakdown location and the interpretation of flow visualizations. One of the distinct features of nonslender wings is the location of the primary attachment zone outboard of the symmetry plane. Reattachment location correlates with the wing stall process and increased buffeting. Dramatic fluid/structure interactions emerge with increasing wing flexibility and result in substantial lift enhancement in the post-stall region. This recently discovered phenomenon appears to be a feature of nonslender wings. Rigid delta wings undergoing small amplitude oscillations in the post-stall region exhibit many similarities to flexible wings, including reattachment and re-formation of the leading-edge vortices. Unusual self-excited roll oscillations have also been observed for free-to-roll nonslender wings. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Scramjet flowpaths employing elliptical combustors have the potential to improve structural efficiency and performance relative to those using planar geometries. NASA Langley has developed a scramjet flowpath that is integrated into a lifting body vehicle, transitions from a rectangular capture area to an elliptical throat, and includes an elliptical combustor. This Rectangular-to-Elliptical Shape Transition (REST) scramjet has a design point of Mach 7.1, and is intended to operate with fixed-geometry between Mach 4.5 and 8.0. This paper describes initial free-jet testing of a heat-sink REST scramjet engine model at conditions simulating Mach 5.3 flight. Combustion of gaseous hydrogen fuel at equivalence ratios between 0.5 and 1.5 generated robust performance after ignition with a silane-hydrogen pilot. Facility- model interactions were experienced for fuel equivalence ratios above 1.1, yet despite this, the flowpath was never unstarted by fuel addition at the Mach 5.3 test condition. Combustion tests resulting in engine unstart at reduced stagnation enthalpy indicated that the inlet/engine self-started following termination of the fuel injection. Engine data is presented for the largest fuel equivalence ratio tested without facility interaction. These results indicate that this class of three-dimensional scramjet engine can operate successfully at off-design conditions.},

The program to optimize simulated trajectories (POST) is modified to include a predictor-corrector guidance capability and then used to generate the trajectories. Significant errors are encountered during the unpowered coast phase due to uncertainty in the atmospheric density profile. The amount of ascent propellant needed is shown to be directly related to the thrust-vector angle and the location of the center of gravity of the vehicle because of the importance of aim-drag losses to total ideal velocity.},

For background this paper summarizes potential benefits of air-breathing propulsion on NASA’s space launch capabilities, as identified by NGLT. Highlights of the X-43 vehicle design and risk reduction process are discussed to set the foundation for ground to flight data and performance comparisons. Highlights of the flight test are presented including flight trajectory, experimental measurements and flight computer visualization. These measurements and results are compared with pretest (and some post test) analysis providing a major, essential demonstration of the capability of the airframe-integrated scramjet engine and hypersonic air-breathing vehicle design tools and vision vehicles. This paper also examines the significance of the flight test in advancing the state-of-the science (vis-\`{a}-vis technology readiness level) and provides a strategic vision for achieving, in the near future, the dream of safe, efficient, reliable and affordable space access achievable with air-breathing propulsion.},

abstract = {Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. Our aim in this study is to apply an optimization method for conceptual designs of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space planes with airbreathing engines on the first-stage boosters and to obtain necessary vehicle sizes and their optimal flight trajectories. First, we integrate analysis methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yield the minimized total dry mass of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO space plane. The optimal solutions show that TSTO space planes with boosters powered by rocket engines added to the airbreathing engines are lighter in total dry mass than vehicles with boosters propelled by only airbreathing engines. However, it is necessary to lighten and miniaturize vehicle components to achieve greater feasibility. In addition, the trajectory optimizations enable the booster to glide back to a launch site using little propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory. This study confirms that the analysis and optimization method proposed are effective.},

abstract = {This report is an introduction to transcription methods for trajectory optimization techniques. The first few sections describe the two classes of transcription methods (shooting \& simultaneous) that are used to convert the trajectory optimization problem into a general constrained optimization form. Hello World! The middle of the report discusses a few extensions to the basic methods, including how to deal with hybrid systems (such as walking robots). The final section goes over a variety of implementation details. 1 Optimal Control Overview There are three types of algorithms for solving optimal control problems[4]: • Dynamic Programming: Solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations over the entire state space. • Indirect Methods: Transcribe problem then find where the slope of the objective is zero. • Direct Methods: Transcribe problem then find the minimum of the objective function. Dynamic programming is an excellent solution to the optimal control problem for unconstrained low-dimensional systems, but it does not scale well to high-dimensional systems, since it requires a discretization of the full state space. Indirect methods tend to be numerically unstable and are difficult to implement and initialize [2]. For the remainder of this paper we will restrict focus to direct methods for transcribing and solving the optimal control problem. The solution to an optimal control problem via transcription scales well to high-dimensional systems, but yields a single trajectory through state and control space, rather than a global policy like dynamic programming.},

@article{Koelle2005,
abstract = {First, the actual change of paradigm for launch systems development is discussed: a future new launch vehicle program will require a clear economic justification, different from that in the past where military requirements, technology demonstration and national prestige were the prime drivers. For the approval of a new vehicle development funding, the following requirements probably need to be fulfilled: The specific transportation cost must be lower (i.e. 50\% or less) than those of existing systems, andthe development cost is to be minimized by modern cost engineering and management principles.These ground rules are valid both for new Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs) as well as for Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs). For Europe, the GTO mission for the launch of geosynchronous satellites is still the prime requirement for the next generation launch system after ARIANE 5. This more complex mission (compared to the previously assumed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) target) makes the definition of the most cost-efficient concept a challenge. Several technical options are feasible. One important factor is the payload capability to be specified: a larger payload (with dual launch capability) reduces the specific transportation cost but increases the vehicle size and the required development effort. These effects are shown in the paper, as well as the impact of the launch rate (annual number of launches) on the specific transportation cost. It is further shown which cost reductions could be expected in principle for future Geo Transfer Orbit (GTO) launch systems, depending on the vehicle concept, the payload capability and launch rate. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A variable-order adaptive pseudospectral method is presented for solving optimal control problems. The method developed in this paper adjusts both the mesh spacing and the degree of the polynomial on each mesh interval until a specified error tolerance is satisfied. In regions of relatively high curvature, convergence is achieved by refining the mesh, while in regions of relatively low curvature, convergence is achieved by increasing the degree of the polynomial. An efficient iterative method is then described for accurately solving a general nonlinear optimal control problem. Using four examples, the adaptive pseudospectral method described in this paper is shown to be more efficient than either a global pseudospectral method or a fixed-order method.

abstract = {For a hypersonic vehicle, propelled by scramjet engines, integration of the engines and airframe is highly desirable. Thus, the forward capture shape of the engine inlet should conform to the vehicle body shape. Furthermore, the use of modular engines places a constraint on the shape of the inlet sidewalls. Finally, one may desire a combustor cross- section shape that is different from that of the inlet. These shape constraints for the inlet can be accommodated by employing a streamline-tracing and lofting technique. This design technique was developed by Smart for inlets with a rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition. In this paper, we generalise that technique to produce inlets that conform to arbitrary shape requirements. As an example, we show the design of a body-integrated hypersonic inlet on a winged-cone vehicle, typical of what might be used in a three-stage orbital launch system. The special challenge of inlet design for this conical vehicle at an angle-of-attack is also discussed. That challenge is that the bow shock sits relatively close to the vehicle body. Nomenclature},

We prove that a sequence of solutions to the PS-discretized constrained problem converges to the optimal solution of the continuous-time optimal control problem under mild and numerically verifiable conditions. The spectral coefficients of the state trajectories provide a practical method to verify the convergence of the computed solution. The proposed ideas are illustrated by several numerical examples.},

Then based on quasi-equilibrium glide condition, the typical inequality reentry trajectory constraints are converted to angle of attack lower boundary constraint. Constrained by the lower boundary, an original and practical angle of attack parametric method is proposed. By using parametric angle of attack profile, optimization algorithm for angle of attack is designed and the impact of angle of attack to footprint is discussed. Simulations with different angle of attack profiles are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed footprint solution method and validity of optimal algorithm. ?? 2012 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.},

In this thesis, we develop a computationally efficient Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) algorithm and describe its software implementation to solve, in real-time, nonlinear optimal trajectory generation problems for constrained systems. NTG is a nonlinear trajectory generation software package that combines nonlinear control theory, B-spline basis functions, and nonlinear programming. We compare NTG with other numerical optimal control problem solution techniques, such as direct collocation, shooting, adjoints, and differential inclusions. We demonstrate the performance of NTG on the Caltech Ducted Fan testbed. Aggressive, constrained optimal control problems are solved in real-time for hover-to-hover, forward flight, and terrain avoidance test cases. Real-time trajectory generation results are shown for both the two-degree of freedom and receding horizon control designs. Further experimental demonstration is provided with the station-keeping, reconfiguration, and deconfiguration of micro-satellite formation with complex nonlinear constraints. Successful application of NTG in these cases demonstrates reliable real-time trajectory generation, even for highly nonlinear and non-convex systems. The results are among the first to apply receding horizon control techniques for agile flight in an experimental setting, using representative dynamics and computation.},

abstract = {Future space transportation vehicles may well rely on high speed airbreathing propulsion (ramjets and scramjets) to supply much of their motive power. Because of the tradeoff relationship between engine thrust and vehicle airframe weight, ascent trajectories are typically simulated using a constant dynamic pressure phase during airbreathing acceleration. That is, dynamic pressure is increased to benefit vehicle thrust up to some fixed limit imposed by the vehicle structure. The constant dynamic pressure portion of the trajectory typically begins around Mach 2 or 3 and continues to the maximum airbreathing Mach number or until some convective aeroheating limit is reached. This paper summarizes comparative research on three candidate guidance methods suitable for simulating constant dynamic pressure trajectories. These are generalized acceleration steering, linear feedback control, and cubic polynomial control. All methods were implemented in POST (Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories) — an industry standard trajectory simulation code. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons of these methods (i.e. in terms of computer processing time, number of required iterations for convergence, sensitivity to quality of initial values, accuracy and program robustness) are presented. Of the three methods, the linear feedback control approach is found to be the most efficient and robust, with good accuracy.},

abstract = {For the solution of optimal control problems, direct methods have been established in the process engineering community. If set up correctly they robustly provide more or less accurate approximations of the exact solution. In the usual engineering practice, neither the distance to the exact solution is reflected, nor the compliance with the continuous necessary conditions in form of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is checked. At the end, some approximate solution is available but its quality is at question. This tutorial addresses the problem of the verification of optimal controls computed by direct shooting methods. We focus on this popular transcription method though the results are also relevant for other solution strategies. We review known results spread in the mathematical literature on optimal control to show how the output of the nonlinear programs (NLPs) resulting from single shooting transcriptions of optimal control problems can be interpreted in the context of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. In particular, we show how to approximate continuous adjoint variables by means of the dual information provided by the NLP solver. Based on this adjoint approximation we use a multi-level setting to construct an estimate of the distance to a true extremal solution satisfying the continuous necessary conditions of optimality. A comprehensive case study illustrates the theoretical results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lu2010,
abstract = {Following extensive development over the past two decades, techniques of inverse simulation have led to a range of successful applications, mainly in the fields of helicopter flight mechanics, aircraft handling qualities and associated issues in terms of model validation. However, the available methods still have some well-known limitations. The traditional methods based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm suffer from numerical problems such as high-frequency oscillations and can have limitations in their applicability due to problems of input-output redundancy. The existing approaches may also show a phenomenon which has been termed “constraint oscillations” which leads to low-frequency oscillatory behaviour in the inverse solutions. Moreover, the need for derivative information may limit their applicability for situations involving manoeuvre discontinuities, model discontinuities or input constraints. 

Two new methods are developed to overcome these issues. The first one, based on sensitivity-analysis theory, allows the Jacobian matrix to be calculated by solving a sensitivity equation and also overcomes problems of input-output redundancy. In addition, it can improve the accuracy of results compared with conventional methods and can deal with the problem of high-frequency oscillations to some extent. The second one, based on a constrained Nelder-Mead search-based optimisation algorithm, is completely derivative-free algorithm for inverse simulation. This approach eliminates problems which make traditional inverse simulation techniques difficult to apply in control applications involving discontinuous issues such as actuator amplitude or rate limits. 

This thesis also offers new insight into the relationship between mathematically based techniques of model inversion and the inverse simulation approach. The similarities and shortcomings of both these methodologies are explored. The findings point to the possibility that inverse simulation can be used successfully within the control system design process for feedforward controllers for model-based output-tracking control system structures. This avoids the more complicated and relatively tedious techniques of model inversion which have been used in the past for feedforward controller design. 

The methods of inverse simulation presented in this thesis have been applied to a number of problems which are concerned mainly with helicopter and ship control problems and include cases involving systems having nonminimum-phase characteristics. The analysis of results for these practical applications shows that the approaches developed and presented in this thesis are of practical importance. It is believed that these developments form a useful step in moving inverse simulation methods from the status of an academic research topic to a practical and robust set of tools for engineering system design.},

abstract = {The pseudospectral (or Fourier) method has been used recently by several investigators for forward seis- mic modeling. The method is introduced here in two different ways: as a limit of finite differences of increas- ing orders, and by trigonometric interpolation. An argu- ment based on spectral analysis of a model equation shows that the pseudospectral method (for the accu- racies and integration times typical of forward elastic seismic modeling) may require, in each space dimension, as little as a quarter the number of grid points com- pared to a fourth-order finite-difference scheme and one-sixteenth the number of points as a second-order finite-difference scheme. For the total number of points in two dimensions, these factors become l/16 and l/256, respectively; in three dimensions, they become l/64 and 114 096, repectively In a series of test calculations on the two-dimensional elastic wave equation, only minor degradations are found in cases with variable coefficients and discontinu- ous intrefaces.},
