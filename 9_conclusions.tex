\chapter{Conclusions}


	\emph{Development of a detailed design and aerodynamic simulation for a rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system.}
	
	

	
\emph{Calculation of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory for the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system using optimal control, with and without fly-back.}

- The optimal ascent trajectory for the rocket-scramjet-rocket three stage launch system involves a pull-up before third stage release. 

- The optimal fly-back of the SPARTAN involves several distinct stages, including a boost phase, skip phase and glide phase. 

- The combined ascent and fly-back trajectory involves the SPARTAN banking during ascent, to mitigate the distance flown during the ascent trajectory. 
	

	
	\emph{Assessment of how key design parameters of the launch system interact with the optimised trajectory.} 
	

	



  \section{Recommendations for future work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Further design optimisation incorporating trajectory optimisation.	
	\item Sizing of entire system for optimal monetary cost efficiency. 
\end{itemize}
