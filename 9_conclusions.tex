\chapter{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The optimal ascent trajectory for the rocket-scramjet-rocket three stage launch system involves a pull-up before third stage release. 
	\item The optimal fly-back of the SPARTAN involves several distinct stages, including a boost phase, skip phase and glide phase. 
	\item Description of conclusions from the combined ascent/fly-back trajectory. The combined ascent and fly-back trajectory involves the SPARTAN banking during ascent, to mitigate the distance flown during the ascent trajectory. 
	\item Summary of conclusions from third stage sizing analysis. 
\end{itemize}

  \section{Recommendations for future work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Further design optimisation incorporating trajectory optimisation.	
	\item Sizing of entire system for optimal monetary cost efficiency. 
\end{itemize}
